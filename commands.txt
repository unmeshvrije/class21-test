ls - show the contents of the directory. ls -a will show all hidden files. ls -l will show more files in long format (more details)

pwd - print the Present Working Directory. What directory am I in?

cd - change directory to the one specified. If no directory is specified this will take you to your home directory. Remember that . is the current directory and .. is the parent directory. So cd . changes the directory to the current directory (does nothing!).

echo - prints the string on screen (on desktop/bash terminal). echo -e "hello\n" will interpret \n as newline.

cat - print the contents of the file - this will print the WHOLE file. If you want to pause printing after a full screen use the below command.

less - show one screen full of the file (spacebar/Enter moves forward and q stops printing)

head - show the beginning of a file e.g. head -3 shows the first 3 lines of the file

tail - show the end of a file tail -4 shows the last 4 lines of the file
